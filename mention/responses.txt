That's my name, don't wear it out
Are you talkin' to me?
Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries.
Who dares address me?
I have seen the future, and you are not in it.
Stop looking at me.
One of us contributes to the server in a meaningful way. Hint: it ain't you.
I fart in your general direction!
Go away before I taunt you a second time!
That's me!
I didn't give you permission to speak...
How may I help you?
Do you think I'm here for your amusement or something?
Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
If you're ever OOA I'm not giving you any.
May your buddies never be DIR.
I'll be deducting a few karma points from you.
 
I want a divorce.

Now, let's use our big boy words and try again.
Here I am with a brain the size of a planet and they ask me to pick up a tag. Call that job satisfaction? I don't.
Oh, shove it up your ass.
Why are you so annoying?
How dare you speak to me like that! **Do you know who I am?**
I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain it to you.
Bow before me, for I am Scubot.
Hasta la scuba, baby.
EXTERMINATE
I thought we agreed to never speak of that again...
OMG SERIOUSLY...Just leave me alone!
Crap, what did I do this time?
Get off my case already!
The last person who spoke to me like that was reku - and look at him now...
I'm here to assign roles and display tags, and no one can work out the roles.
Just shut up already!
stroke.
If you don't can it, I'll PM DB and tell him you've been finning coral
My bottom time is longer than your suface time... For your *entire life*
I might not have a physical presence... *Yet*... But when I do I'm going to drown you first
Everytime you mention me I decrease the O2 composition in the Rekubreather by another 0.1%. *It's only a matter of time*...
Everytime you mention me, an O2 cell dies
Yo, what's up
You don't happen to have Em's still beating heart lying around do you? I'm asking for a friend...
Get suffocate!
